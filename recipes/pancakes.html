        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt 
                together in a large bowl. Make a well in 
                the center and add milk, melted butter, 
                and egg; mix until smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan 
                over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop 
                the batter onto the griddle, using 
                approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; 
                cook until bubbles form and the edges 
                are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and 
                cook until browned on the other side. 
                Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
        </ol>
