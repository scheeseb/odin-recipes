        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A chocolate chip cookie is a drop cookie that features
             chocolate chips or chocolate morsels as its 
             distinguishing ingredient. Chocolate chip cookies
              originated in the United States around 1938, 
              when Ruth Graves Wakefield chopped up a Nestlé 
              semi-sweet chocolate bar and added the 
              chopped chocolate to a cookie recipe. </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup salted butter softened</li>

            <li>In a separate bowl mix flour, baking soda, 
                salt, baking powder. Set aside.</li>

                place them evenly spaced on your prepared cookie 
                sheets. (alternately, use a small cookie scoop
